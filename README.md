System for Traditional karate do tournament execution, replacing forming protocols and doing manual work filling them.

The system includes:
1) Kumite contest execution with alternating match selection to similarly represent the manual protocols;
2) Kata contest execution with alternating match execution, double elimination bracket.
3) Kata contest execution with point system

Upcoming features:
1) Option to let user select if there should be 1 third place or 2.
2) Protocol forming for better visualization of the current state and results.

Would be good add-ons:
1) Using database for storing information instead of a txt file

## 2025 note
I intend to redo the application with React + Typescript, ASP.NET and MySQL database. Currently I am at the stage of collecting changed requirements for the application and planning, actively communicating and collaborating with current users.
