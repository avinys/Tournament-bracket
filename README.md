System for Traditional karate do tournament execution, replacing forming protocols and doing manual work filling them.

The system includes:
1) Kumite contest execution with alternating match selection to similarly represent the manual protocols;
2) Kata contest execution with alternating match execution, double elimination bracket.
3) Kata contest execution with point system

Upcoming features:
1) Option to let user select if there should be 1 third place or 2.
2) Protocol forming for better visualization of the current state and results.
3) On-screen vizualization for user of the current tournament state

Would be good add-ons:
1) Using database for storing information instead of a txt file
